Ingredients


1 lb ground turkey
1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs (I use whole wheat)
3 tablespoons onions, minced
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon soy sauce
1/4 teaspoon paprika
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 teaspoon liquid red pepper seasoning (optional)
black pepper, to taste
6 hamburger buns, to serve




Directions


Combine all ingredients in large bowl.
Shape into 6 patties.
Pan-fry, broil, or grill until lightly browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.
Serve in hamburger buns with desired toppings.
My fave toppings: lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, and fat-free/light mayo.
